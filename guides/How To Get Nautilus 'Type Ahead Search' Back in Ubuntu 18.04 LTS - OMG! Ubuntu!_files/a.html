 install the packages myself and look them over. I don't 
promote/feature/recommend PPAs that I wouldn't use myself, and if it's a
 "kitchen sink" PPAs that has about a gazillion packages in, I usually 
give a warning.</p><p>The packages in this PPA seem to have been built 
by someone who was involved in the bug report discussions etc, which, 
for me at least, suggests they're not some fly-by-night malware 
spreader.</p><p>But yes, there are inherent security risks with 
third-party PPAs and repositories -- and users should always 
double-check things themselves. That said, I don't think anyone has ever
 actually acquired or repurposed a PPA and used it to spread malware. 
But, yeah, it's always possible. It's why new technologies like Snap and
 Flatpak have emerged.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div><a href="#" class="vote-up  count-9" data-action="upvote" title="" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">9</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a> <a href="#" role="button" class="vote-down  count-0" data-action="downvote" title="Vote down" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="reply" data-role="reply-link"><a href="#" data-action="reply"><span class="text">Reply</span></a></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" tabindex="0"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><li class="twitter"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</button></li><li class="facebook"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</button></li><li class="link"><input class="share__button" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly="readonly" value="http://disq.us/p/1sfjlus"></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:3895944292"><span style="display: none;" class="realtime-replies"></span><a style="display: none;" href="#" class="realtime-button"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><div class="children"><ul data-role="children"><li class="post" id="post-3896004970"><div role="alert"></div><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu" data-view-id="post-menu" data-post-id="3896004970"><li class="collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li><li class="" role="menuitem"><div><a class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" href="#"><b class="caret"></b></a><ul class="dropdown-menu"><li><a href="#" data-action="block-user" role="menuitem">Block User</a></li><li><a href="#" data-action="flag" role="menuitem">Flag as inappropriate</a></li></ul></div></li></ul><div class="avatar hovercard"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/benjaoming/" data-action="profile" data-username="benjaoming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="user"><img data-role="user-avatar" data-user="28330387" src="avatar92.jpg" alt="Avatar"></a></div><div class="post-body"><header class="comment__header"><span class="post-byline"><span> <span class="author publisher-anchor-color"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/benjaoming/" data-action="profile" data-username="benjaoming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">benjaoming</a></span> </span><span> <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2018/05/enable-nautilus-type-ahead-search-ubuntu#comment-3895944292" class="parent-link" data-role="parent-link"><i aria-label="in reply to" class="icon-forward" title="in reply to"></i> Joe Sneddon</a></span></span> <span class="post-meta"><span class="bullet time-ago-bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</span> <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2018/05/enable-nautilus-type-ahead-search-ubuntu#comment-3896004970" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago" title="Friday, May 11, 2018 3:28 PM">a year ago</a></span> </header><div class="post-body-inner"><div class="post-message-container" data-role="message-container"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>Thanks for the response.
